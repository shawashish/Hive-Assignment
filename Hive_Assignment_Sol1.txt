    stored as orc;

6. Load data from "sales_order_csv" into "sales_order_orc"
Ans - from sales_order_csv insert overwrite table sales_order_orc select *;

Ans -
select distinct year_id,month_id,total_qo from
(select total_qo,year_id,month_id,
rank() over(partition by year_id order by total_qo desc) as rank
from(
select sum(quantityordered) over(partition by year_id,month_id) as total_qo,year_id,month_id from sales_order_orc) a)b
where rank = 1
order by year_id;
